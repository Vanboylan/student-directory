# student-directory

This directory allows you to manage the attendees of Villains Academy

##How to use

```shell

This directory was created as part of the Makers precourse, and was the week four focus before getting to the main aspect of the course.

In this directory, there is a working command line program that can read and write CSV data relating to a cohort that you input using the 
interactive menu. There is a write feature, an autofill field for the monthly cohort, a save feature, a load feature and an exit. 

In this project, I explored formatting on command line, making code readable and succinct, and worked with classes and CSV files.
It was important for me to learn more about class variables, and put the DRY method into practice, along with regular commits and constant TDD practice.
